# DataScienceandMachineLearning_Project_SophieDAYA_MathiasHaberli
Predict the difficulty of French text using AI

## Overview of our project
We created a startup, LogoRank, to revolutionise language learning. Our repository contains the code, data, and documentation for our machine learning model that predicts the difficulty level of French texts (from A1 to C2). This project aims to build a model that can predict the difficulty level of French texts. Indeed, it would help learners to find texts that match their skill level.

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Advanced techniques: BERT embeddings

### Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate our models using the following metrics:
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Accuracy

### Best Model
Which is the best model? Based on our evaluations, the best performing model is BERT. Below is a summary of the results:

| Model                 | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Accuracy |
|-----------------------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 0.464049  |0.466667| 0.462684 | 0.466667 |
| KNN                   | 0.404224  |0.358333| 0.34642  | 0.358333 |
| Decision Tree         | 0.318825  |0.322917| 0.315863 | 0.336198 |
| Random Forest         | 0.41074   |0.413542| 0.400764 | 0.413542 |
| BERT                  |           |        |          |          |
